# Welcome to The Library:
Heyo! Welcome to the Library. The purpose of this project is pretty much a glorified file explorer. 
I have a bunch of pdf for like textbooks, educational books, etc and I am string to self host. Aside from setting up sym links, 
I wanted to try to make a web interface to view the files.   
This would be hosted in the same storage space as your pdfs (with all of your folders) and load and display all of those 
pdfs, epubs, etc. At this moment, I am not sure what is possible, but these are the proposed features:
 - Dynamic book groupings
 - Image previews
 - File downloads

### What I need to learn:
I don't know too much about security in the Kotlin/ktor perspective. In order to have a solid app for self hosting, 
I would like to get better security established for things like the storage and transmission of login credentials
